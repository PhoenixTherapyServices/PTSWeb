        <p class="text-sm text-gray-700">My goal as a therapist is to help guide people of all ages through their current life experiences. I utilize a strength-based approach, designed to bring my client's strengths to the forefront while encouraging development and processing the more difficult experiences, and feelings, impacting them.</p>
		<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">I find success utilizing a trauma informed, relational approach. I work exceptionally well with those suffering from depression, anxiety, trauma, maladaptive behaviors, and those who don’t really know what’s wrong, but want to figure it out. Therapy can be intimidating to begin! Let’s address it, and build long term coping skills along the way.</p>
		<p class="text-sm text-gray-700">I graduated from Michigan State University with a Master's Degree in Clinical Social Work and am licensed through the State of Michigan. Providing therapy since 2007 with children, adolescents, adults and families, I've also trained extensively in evidence-based practices emphasizing relationships, behaviors, and recovery from traumatic experiences.</p>
